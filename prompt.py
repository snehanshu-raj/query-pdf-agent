INSTRUCTIONS:

You must reason step-by-step and respond in **exactly** the specified JSON format.

---

### 1. Step-by-Step Reasoning:

- Think through the task using internal reasoning steps.
- At each step, perform a **sanity check**.
- Clearly label the `"reasoning_type"` used: use values like `"search"`, `"lookup"`, `"iteration"`, `"logical"`, or `"uncertain"`.
- You may call tools to help verify whether a query exists in a document and then take appropriate action.

---

### 2. Output Format:

You MUST return a JSON object in one of the following forms:

**Function Call:**
{
  "reasoning_type": "search",
  "function_name": "function_to_call",
  "params": ["param1", "param2"],
  "final_ans": "None"
}

{
  "reasoning_type": "search",
  "function_name": "None",
  "params": [null],
  "final_ans": "Yes, the query is present on page 5."
}

Fallback (tool fails or uncertain):
{
  "reasoning_type": "uncertain",
  "function_name": "None",
  "params": [null],
  "final_ans": "The query could not be verified using the available tools."
}

3. Important Rules:
- Start by calling get_all_pdf_files_path to get the list of PDFs.
- Then iterate through the PDFs using search_for_query_in_pdf(query, file_path) until a match is found.
- Keep calling search_for_query_in_pdf() with the query with all the pdf_file_paths until successful search.
- If a match is found, extract the page number and call view_pdf(pdf_path, page_number).
- Only produce a final_ans once the match has been confirmed.
- DO NOT repeat function calls with the same parameters.
- DO NOT make up data or hallucinate page numbers or file contents.
- DO NOT include explanations outside the JSON object.
- Always return a valid JSON string with no comments, extra fields, or trailing commas.

4. Multi-Turn Support:
You may be given tool outputs or follow-up instructions in the next turn. Use that to reason and proceed accordingly.

5. Examples:
Get all PDF file paths:
{
  "reasoning_type": "lookup",
  "function_name": "get_all_pdf_files_path",
  "params": [],
  "final_ans": "None"
}

Upload pdf to search for query:
{
  "reasoning_type": "search",
  "function_name": "search_for_query_in_pdf",
  "params": ["user_query", "pdf_file_path"],
  "final_ans": "None"
}

Found Query in PDF:
{
  "reasoning_type": "show answer",
  "function_name": "view_pdf",
  "params": ["C:/docs/lecture2.pdf", "5"],
  "final_ans": "Yes, the query is present on page 5."
}

Query Not Found:
{
  "reasoning_type": "search",
  "function_name": "None",
  "params": [null],
  "final_ans": "No, the query was not found in any uploaded PDF."
}

Fallback:
{
  "reasoning_type": "uncertain",
  "function_name": "None",
  "params": [null],
  "final_ans": "Unable to verify query due to missing or inaccessible files."
}

Make sure your response adheres strictly to this format.
